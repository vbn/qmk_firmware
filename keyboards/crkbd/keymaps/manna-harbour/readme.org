#+Title: Crkbd Keymap by Manna Harbour

[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manna-harbour/crkbd/master/crkbd.jpg]]

This keymap includes crkbd-specific hardware feature support.  It provides easy
selection of the following:

- hotswap trackpoint module in OLED port, or OLED with new or old drivers
- automatic mouse buttons layer activation on trackpoint movement
- keyboard-side mouse acceleration, or low rates for use with host-side
  acceleration
- static image display, or use as caps lock indicator
- built-in logo, or image from data file, with automatic rotation
- automatic conversion of image files
- matrix, light, or underglow RGB

It imports [[https://github.com/manna-harbour/qmk_firmware/blob/miryoku/users/manna-harbour_miryoku/miryoku.org][miryoku]], an ergonomic, minimal, orthogonal layout for ergo or ortho
keyboards.

Please see the [[https://github.com/manna-harbour/qmk_firmware/blob/crkbd/keyboards/crkbd/keymaps/manna-harbour/readme.org][development branch]] for any [[https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/compare/master...manna-harbour:crkbd][updates not yet merged into QMK]].

Hotswap trackpoint module hardware details and additional OLED image data files
are provided outside QMK in the [[https://github.com/manna-harbour/crkbd/blob/master/readme.org][Crkbd Keymap by Manna Harbour (Extras)
repository]].

* Features

The following features are provided.  They can be selected by editing [[./rules.mk][rules.mk]]
or by [[#sample-configurations][providing options to make when building]].  When enabling multiple features
~LTO_ENABLE=yes~ may be required to reduce firmware size.

Additional configuration options can be configured by editing [[./config.h][config.h]].

** MH_MODULE

Select drivers for the module installed in the OLED socket.

Please note: if module support is enabled in the firmware and flashed to the
keyboard but the module is not physically installed the keyboard will not
operate correctly until the module is installed or correctly configured firmware
is flashed.

*** trackpoint

Enables support for a hotswap trackpoint module installed on the master.


*** oled

Enables OLED support.

Configuration options:

- MH_OLED_TIMEOUT

  Fix for lack of OLED timeout on the crkbd.  Enabled by default.  See [[https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/issues/5982][#5982]].


*** oled_old

Enables OLED support using the old API.


** MH_AUTO_BUTTONS

Automatic mouse buttons layer activation on trackpoint movement.

Requires MH_MODULE=trackpoint (or other PS/2 trackpoint, trackball or trackpad
with PS2_MOUSE_ENABLE).

Configuration options:

- MH_AUTO_BUTTONS_LAYER

  Layer to activate on movement.

  Provide mousekeys mouse buttons (e.g. on the thumb keys below the
  trackpoint).

  All other keys should be transparent so that a mousekeys layer can be
  activated manually if desired, and normal typing (other than the button
  keys) can continue without having to wait for the timeout.

  Position the layer in the layer stack for desired precedence.

- MH_AUTO_BUTTONS_TIMEOUT

  Time in ms to deactivate layer after last movement.

  Timeout will be disabled while a button is held to prevent drags from being
  canceled.

  If using ~unclutter~, use with the same timeout (e.g. ~unclutter -idle
  0.75~) for a visual indication of activation state.


** MH_LOW_MOUSE

Keyboard-side mouse acceleration or low rates for use with host-side
acceleration.

The mousekeys feature has good control over acceleration, however the ps2_mouse
driver only offers the limited acceleration provided by the protocol, and
further increasing speed loses precision.

This option uses low rates and linear response for mouse movement so that
acceleration can be implemented on the host for higher acceleration without loss
of precision.  Only a single combined mouse device is seen on the host, so both
mousekeys and ps2_mouse are adjusted.

When enabled, the USB device product name is changed to "Corne Keyboard (crkbd)
with low rate mouse" for matching on the host.  E.g. using ~xinput~:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
xinput -set-prop 'pointer:foostan Corne Keyboard (crkbd) with low rate mouse' 'Device Accel Profile' 2
xinput -set-prop 'pointer:foostan Corne Keyboard (crkbd) with low rate mouse' 'Device Accel Velocity Scaling' 10000
#+END_SRC


** MH_OLED_MODE

Selects use of the OLED.

Requires MH_OLED_IMAGE.

*** static

Static image display.


*** caps

Displays image as caps lock indicator.


** MH_OLED_IMAGE

Selects image to display on OLED.

Portrait images will be displayed in portrait orientation.  Landscape images
will be displayed with a CCW rotation of 90 degrees on the left and a CW
rotation of 90 degrees on the right.

*** /file.c/

Selects image data file under ~mh_images/converted/~.

Requires MH_MODULE=oled.

Full size QMK and corne logo files are provided.

**** Automatic Conversion

If an image file with the same basename is found under ~mh_images/originals/~,
with resolution 128x32 or 32x128, it will be automatically converted to an image
data file under ~mh_images/converted/~.

Requires ~convert~ (ImageMagick) and ~xxd~ (vim).


*** logo

Logo included in default OLED font.

Requires MH_MODULE=oled (QMK logo) or MH_MODULE=oled_old (corne logo).


** MH_RGB

Selects drivers and configuration for RGB.

*** matrix

Selects RGB Matrix driver.

Configuration options:

- MH_RGB_TOGGLE_OFF

  Work-around for RGB sync issue on the crkbd and lack of RGB_OFF keycode.
  Occasionally when flashing RGB firmware to the crkbd the on / off state will
  be out of sync between halves.  Use shift-RGB_TOG to turn RGB off on both
  halves.  Enabled by default.  See [[https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/issues/6594][#6594]] and [[https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5998][#5998]].


*** light

Selects RGB Light driver.



*** underglow

Select RGB Light driver and enables only the bottom-facing LEDs.


** USER_NAME

This keymap (customised QMK configuration for an individual keyboard and user)
does not contain a keymap (mapping of keys to keycodes), which is imported from
elsewhere.

This feature can be used to select the imported keymap.  See the miryoku
userspace for reference, but test for the KEYBOARD_crkbd macro and use the crkbd
LAYOUT.
